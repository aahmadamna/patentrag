A Retrieval-Augmented Patent Q&amp;A &amp; Summarization Engine with Cache-Augmented Generation
PatentRAG+CAG is an AI-powered patent intelligence assistant that transforms days of manual prior-art hunting, infringement analysis, and freedom-to-operate (FTO) scanning into a few clicks. It combines:

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Users pose natural-language questions (“What prior art anticipates Claim 4?”, “Does this spec infringe Claim 2?”, “Which patents block my new design?”). The system retrieves the most semantically relevant passages from a large patent corpus and then invokes an LLM to generate concise, citation-backed answers, formatted as 102/103 charts, infringement evidence tables, or ranked FTO blocker lists.

CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation): Intermediate results—query embeddings, search outputs, full AI responses—are cached so any repeat or near-duplicate query runs in milliseconds, dramatically cutting latency and API costs.

Executive Summaries: One-click, three-bullet overviews of any patent (problem, novelty, key claims), exportable to Markdown or PDF for briefs and presentations.
